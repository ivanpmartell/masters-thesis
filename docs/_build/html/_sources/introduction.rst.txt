Introduction
============
This project started with the need for comparing promoter recognition programs in the literature.

So far we have implemented 3 models, with more in progress.

The models include:

- CNNPROM, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171410
- ICNN, DOI: 10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00072
- DPROM, DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2019.00286

We have also created a way to test the models in a unified manner that mimics a realistic scenario.

All of this has been outlined in more detail in my `thesis <http://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/11701>`_
